This single page application will help users create their own profile, learn the basic algorithms through animation, and share comments of which algorithm they like most. The page also has comment for users to communicate with each other.
I build a Single Page Application (SPA). Building this application will be challenging because it will integrate everything I've learned up to this point. Frontend will be built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and will communicate with a public API.

# Features
* Create user's own profile
* Providing cat's image as avatar, clicking the button will give new random cat image for user.
* Users can pick two algorithms and corresponding gif of them will be shown, this allows user to view and compare the speed of each algorithm.
* Users can submit comment about their best-pick.
