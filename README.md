This single page application allows users to create their own profile, to learn the basic algorithms through animation, and to share comments of which algorithm they like most. The page also has comment for users to communicate with each other.
The idea came in when I first learn sorting algorithms. I have tried to generate my own way of sorting an array of numbers but failed. After reading those famous algorithm I was impressed by talents behind them. I want to share my apprerciation to others and think this is the best way to present it.
I build a Single Page Application (SPA). Building this application is challenging anad it integrates everything I've learned up to this point. Frontend is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and will communicate with a public API.

# Features
* Create user's own profile
* Providing cat's image as avatar, clicking the button will give new random cat image for user.
* Users can pick two algorithms and corresponding gif of them will be shown, this allows user to view and compare the speed of each algorithm.
* Users can submit comment about their best-pick.
